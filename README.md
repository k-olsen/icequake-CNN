# icequake-CNN
Data and code to analyze results of a convolutional neural network built to detect icequakes from continuous seismic data. Seismic data were collected as part of the Ross Ice Shelf seismic network deployed in Antarctica from 2014-2016. Details of this project can be found in [this blog post](https://k-olsen.github.io/projects/icequake-CNN/). 

CNN was trained on 24,000 8-s event/noise windows using computing resources on the DeepThought2 cluster at the University of Maryland, College Park. Data are not included in this repository due to size constraints. If you are interested in learning more or running this code yourself please get in touch.
